- Create a custom player view with UIKit.
- Use Rx family pods like RxSwift, RxCoco, etc.
- Use Rxflow for navigation.
- Use Nuke for image loading.

## Installation

To run the UIKit version you have to install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) first. than run `pod install` in project folder.



To use this app, you have to create your public API key by following this link: [Vimeo developer](https://developer.vimeo.com/)

This app works well with a public token, which is **an “Unauthenticated”** token, but to get all features, you must check the “**Authenticated”** token, then check the **private**, **interact,** and **stats** options.

After that, put the token in `Constants.swift` in the **AppConstants** folder instead of `{Put your token here}`.

```swift
struct Constants{
    struct Vimeo{
        static let Vimeo_base_url = "https://api.vimeo.com/"
        static let Vimeo_video_config_url = "https://player.vimeo.com/video/{id}/config"

        /// You can create your own public api key from this link:https://developer.vimeo.com/
        static let public_token = "{Put your token here}"
    }
}
```
